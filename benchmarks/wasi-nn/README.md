# WASI-NN

[wasi-nn](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-nn) is a proposed [WebAssembly System Interface](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI) API for machine
learning (ML). This benchmark uses wasi-nn with the OpenVINO backend to identify the subject of the test image. It measures the time required for a
single inference to run.

## Note:
You must install OpenVINO to run this benchmark. Run `setup.sh` prior to running the benchmark.
